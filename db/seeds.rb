rec1 = Recipe.create(title: "Pan Fried Tater Cakes", series: "LOTR", image_url: "https://i.imgur.com/ME7BMcz.jpg", prep_time: "25 minutes", 
ingredients: 
["1 cup shredded potatoes", 
"2 cups mashed potatoes", 
"1 cup flour", 
"1 large onion, minced", 
"1/2 c shredded cheddar", 
"1/4 cup whole milk", 
"2 garlic gloves, minced", 
"1 tbsp coarse salt", 
"1 tsp fresh ground black pepper", 
"4 tbsp softened butter, plus 4-6 tbsp butter for frying"],
    
instructions: 
"Peel and grate your raw potatoes. To reduce the starch, soak them in cold water for five minutes. Don‚Äôt skip this step. It makes a big difference. While the raw potatoes are soaking, mix your leftover mashed potatoes, flour, minced onion, minced garlic, salt, pepper, milk, shredded cheese and softened butter. You should end up with something a little thicker than lumpy pancake batter. Drain your raw potato shreds, give them one last rinse, and mix them into the batter. 
Melt a tbsp of butter in a large skillet over medium heat ‚Äì no hotter! Drop in a heaping tbsp full of batter and use the back of a spoon to flatten it slightly. You should be able to fry 3 potato cakes in a round pan or four in a square one. 
Here‚Äôs the hard part. Once your potato cakes are nice and round, leave them alone. Let them sizzle away over medium heat for about ten minutes. Low and slow wins this race. If your first batch starts to burn before 10 minutes are up, turn down the heat. When you flip the tater cakes, the bottom side should be a lovely dark golden brown. Let them crisp up for another 6-8 minutes on the second side. 
Since they are a bit time-consuming, don‚Äôt be afraid of making two pans at once. Just stagger the flipping. Put down three potato cakes in the first pan. Wait five minutes, put three in a second pan, wait five more five minutes. You can get into a good rhythm of flipping one skillet and adding new batter to the other.
In addition to making great gravy sops, these small, round potato cakes also taste surprisingly good with a sprinkle of coarse salt and a dollop of fresh applesauce.")

ingredients:
["4 large Portabella mushroom caps",
"1/2 tbsp butter",
"1 c / 200 g homemade Country Sausage (pg 15) or vegan sausage crumbles",
"1 medium onion, diced",
"1 clove garlic, minced",
"1 tsp salt",
"1 tsp dried herbs (rosemary or basil)",
"¬Ω tsp fresh ground pepper",
"1 egg, beaten",
"1 1/2 c / 270 g dried breadcrumbs + 4 tbsp reserved (substitute ground cornflakes if gluten free)",
"¬Ω c shredded mozzarella cheese (optional)"], 

instructions: 
"Gently wash the mushroom caps and remove any remaining bits of stem. Let them sit out on a rack to dry while you brown the sausage.
Melt ¬Ω tbsp of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook your breakfast sausage until browned through. Once fully browned, add it to a mixing bowl. In the same skillet, add your diced onion, minced garlic, dried herbs, salt, and pepper. Cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the onion is translucent and the garlic starts to brown. Add it to the mixing bowl full of sausage.
Once the mix is cool enough to touch, add the beaten egg. Use your hands to knead the sausage, vegetables, and herbs together with the egg binder. Once they‚Äôre all mixed, add all but 4 tbsp of breadcrumbs and keep mixing until the crumbs have soaked up a lot of the moishture.
Divide the mix into four parts. Gently press each one into a mushroom cap, taking care not to split the mushroom.
Sprinkle each mushroom with 1 tbsp of reserved breadcrumbs. If you‚Äôd like, you can also add a couple tablespoons of shredded cheese. Bake at 350F / 180C for 15 minutes-18 minutes. Let cool slightly before eating.
If you‚Äôre having a grand meal, serve one of these alongside one chop from your roast rack of lamb so everyone feels like they had a hearty, somewhat grand main course. You‚Äôll save money while also looking quite fancy.
For a more modest Shire inspired meal, serve these alongside mashed potatoes, green peas cooked with rosemary, and a hunk of fresh bread.")

"1/2 cup cornstarch"],

instructions: 
"Grease a 9-inch-by-13-inch pan and line it with plastic wrap. Greasing the
bottom and sides helps the plastic stick to the pan. Set aside until needed.
To make the sugar syrup, combine the sugar, cream of tartar, and water in a
large saucepan. Cook over high heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar is
dissolved, 5 to 10 minutes. Wash the sides of the pan with a pastry brush
dipped in hot water and clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan.
Continue cooking over medium-high heat without stirring until the mixture
reaches 290¬∞F. Remove from the heat and stir until the temperature drops a
few degrees to prevent scorching. The temperature will first rise a few more
degrees and then fall. Cover the saucepan.
To make the cornstarch paste, whisk together the cornstarch, lemon juice,
and water in a large saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking
constantly, until the mixture turns into a thick paste, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour
the sugar syrup into the cornstarch paste in 5 or 6 batches, whisking after
each batch until smooth. Raise the temperature to medium-high and
continue cooking, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to prevent
scorching, until the mixture turns a light golden color and is very thick and
gelatinous, about 30 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat, add the rose water or orange blossom water, and stir until smooth.
Scrape the mixture into the prepared pan and spread with the wooden
spoon. The mixture will be hard to spread, so don‚Äôt worry if it‚Äôs imperfect.
Cover with plastic wrap and cool completely at room temperature, 5 hoursor overnight.
When the candy is completely cool, remove the slab from the pan and cut
into 1-inch pieces (make 7 cuts along the width and 11 cuts along the
length). Sift together the confectioners‚Äô sugar and cornstarch in a large
mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Toss several pieces of the candy at a
time into the confectioners‚Äô sugar‚Äìcornstarch mixture to coat. Store in an
airtight container between layers of plastic wrap or parchment paper.")
